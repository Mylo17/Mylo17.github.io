## Hardware

- Keyboard: Drevo Tyrfing V2 with outemu brown switches
- Mouse: Aukey GM-F4
- Custom built PC
  - CPU: Ryzen 5 2600 6 cores
  - Ram: Corsair Vengeance 16 gb
  - GPU: Radeon RX550

## Geneal Apps

- [Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) - My browser of choice, very fast with a polished look
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - The best for privacy focused browsing coupled with [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - Great open source password manager with great integration with every device. Possible to self-host
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com) - My go to app to listen to music
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com) - Open source alternative to Roam Research

## Development Apps

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - My favourite all around editor for almost any language. Here you can find my [configuration](https://link) and [extension's list](https://link)
- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - By far the best terminal experience on Windows.
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) - Don't really like it that much but i use it for more complex Java projects that VSCode does not handle well
