# [Mylo's personal website](https://mylo17.github.io)

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the theme is [Hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) becasue of its simplicity and system-based dark mode support.

The markdown and Hugo files are on the main branch. When the branch changes, a GitHub Action will automatically push the rendered version of the site to the gh-pages branch and subsequetly publishes it.
